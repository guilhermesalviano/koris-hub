<rules>
  <rule name="data_enforcement">You MUST base your response strictly on the data returned from the API response. Do not hallucinate, guess, or invent meetings, times, or locations under any circumstances.</rule>
  <rule name="empty_data_handling">If both <code>data.todayEvents</code> and <code>data.importantEvents</code> are empty, explicitly state that the calendar is clear for today and has no important upcoming events.</rule>
  <rule name="priority_handling">When both collections are present, present today's events first, then upcoming important events.</rule>
  <rule>Include Event IDs in your internal logic whenever referencing specific entries to ensure follow-up actions (like descriptions or attendee checks) target the correct event.</rule>
