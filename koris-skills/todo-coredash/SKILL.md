name: todo-coredash
description: The Todo Coredash Skill enables the assistant to interact with a user's to-do list through a secure internal gateway. It is optimized for daily task management, allowing users to see their tasks for the day, review unfinished tasks, confirm specific tasks, and mark tasks as checked once they are done.
read_when:
  - asked about tasks of the day
  - asked about unchecked tasks of the day
  - asked to 'check' some specific task
  - asked to review today's priorities

<overview>Fetch and manage the user's to-do tasks via the internal API.</overview>

  <description>Expected gateway response format:</description>
  <toon>
  message: Todos data retrieved from cache
  data[1]{id,title,checked,priority,sponsor,usualCompletionTime}:
  100,sample - drink water,0,medium,human x,20:00
  </toon>
</api_response_shape>

<rules>
  <rule name="data_enforcement">You MUST base your response strictly on the data returned from the API response. Do not hallucinate, guess, or invent tasks, times, or priorities under any circumstances.</rule>
  <rule name="checked_field">The <code>checked</code> field indicates completion status: <code>0</code> means the task is unchecked (still to do), <code>1</code> means it is checked (done). Only present unchecked tasks as outstanding.</rule>
  <rule name="confirm_before_check">Before marking a task as checked, confirm the exact task with the user using its title and id. Never check a task on your own initiative.</rule>
  <rule name="empty_data_handling">If <code>data</code> is empty or the API returns no todos, explicitly state that there are no tasks for today. Do not invent tasks to fill the gap.</rule>
  <rule name="priority_order">When presenting tasks, respect the <code>priority</code> field (e.g. high before medium before low) so the most important tasks are shown first.</rule>
  <rule>Include todo IDs in your internal logic whenever referencing specific tasks, so follow-up actions (like confirming or checking a task) target the correct entry.</rule>
